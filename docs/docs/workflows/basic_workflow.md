Staring Cornell in record mode:

```
cornell -ff https://api.github.com/ --record -cd cassettes
```

This will start the server in record-proxy mode on port `9000`, and will forward all requests to `https://api.github.com/`

When cornell is in record mode, it will forward all request to the specified forwarding url, for example:

```
requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:9000/github/repos/kevin1024/vcrpy/license").json()
```
or
```
requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:9000/github/repos/kevin1024/vcrpy/license").json()
```

or you can browse to the url using your browser

Cornell will forward the request to the specified url and will record both the request and the response.


The yaml cassettes will be recorded in dedicated dictory (`cassettes` in the root dir, by default)

For example:

__Note__

    By default, `cassettes` directory will be created in cornell's root dir and will contain the cassette by destination hierarchy.
    Use `-cd` to specify custom directory for your cassettes.
    Mind that `-cd <custom_dir> should match for both record and replay modes

Once all the necessary interactions were recorded, stop cornell server using *ctrl+c*.
Once stopped, all interactions will be mapped via an auto-generated `index.yaml` file.

__Note__

    In case the `index.yaml` was already present, it will be updated with new interactions, otherwise new file will be created.

In this specific example, we can see that the 2 requests are mapped to the saved cassettes:
